Lagan Slug Property Controller
==============================

Controller for the Lagan Position property.  
Creates a slug from a string, and checks if it's unique. If it is not unique, a random string is added to the end of the slug. If the property is submitted empty, or *autovalue* is set to true for this property, the title property value is used to create a slug. If there is no title the id is used.

To be used with [Lagan](https://github.com/lutsen/lagan). Lagan lets you create flexible content objects with a simple class, and manage them with a web interface.

Lagan is a project of [LÃºtsen Stellingwerff](http://lutsen.land/) from [HoverKraft](http://www.hoverkraft.nl/).
